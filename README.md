Don't remember how many times I wrote this framework from scratch ut always found some new metodology, just... enjoy it

Having a strong error handler its to me the esential, one of my ideas was to have all the core in one place so 
I don't need to copy over and over again the same files well my case its I have all my apps in one domain, 
just its a big project splited in few modules so each one its independent of the rest, but can inherit layouts, 
stylesheet, js from the default layout

Maybe I will use a NotORM like for the model, seems more fun for small quick projects...
